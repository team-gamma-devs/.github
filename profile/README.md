## Who We Are

**Team Gamma Devs** is a student-led developer association based in Uruguay. We're a group of passionate students dedicated to improving our programming skills through hands-on, innovative projects. We believe in learning by building real applications, collaborating with each other, and pushing ourselves to explore modern technologies and best practices.

---

## What We're Working On

We focus on building full-stack applications using modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure. Our projects span from web applications to AI integrations, each chosen to challenge us and expand our technical capabilities.

### Full-Stack Web Development

We build complete web applications using **SvelteKit** and **Next.js** for the frontend, paired with **FastAPI** and **Python** on the backend. Our applications feature responsive designs with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring they work seamlessly across all devices. We emphasize writing clean, maintainable code and following modern development practices.

### AI & Automation

We're actively exploring artificial intelligence through **PydanticAI**, integrating intelligent features into our applications. This includes natural language processing, automated workflows, and data-driven insights. We're learning how to build AI-powered tools that solve real problems.

### Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps

Our deployment strategy centers on **AWS** and **Vercel**, with **Docker Compose** for containerization and local development. We're learning to build scalable, production-ready infrastructure with automated deployments, monitoring, and proper security practices.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

We use **Cypress** for end-to-end testing to ensure our applications work reliably. Testing is an integral part of our development process, helping us catch issues early and build confidence in our code.

### Systems Programming

We're expanding into **Rust** and **Leptos** to explore high-performance systems programming and modern web frameworks. This allows us to understand lower-level concepts and build faster, more efficient applications.

---

## What We Bring

**Fresh Perspectives** — We approach problems creatively with modern solutions and aren't bound by legacy thinking.

**Speed** — We move fast. Really fast. We often leave more experienced developers wondering how we got it done so quickly.

**Continuous Learning** — Every project teaches us something new. We're constantly researching, experimenting, and improving our craft.

**Collaborative Spirit** — We work together, review each other's code, and share knowledge freely within our team.

**No Bullshit, No Politics** — We're here to build cool stuff, not deal with corporate nonsense. Straight talk, honest feedback, and zero drama.

**Modern Tech Stack** — We focus on current, industry-relevant technologies that are actually in demand right now.

**Quality Focus** — We're learning to write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code from the start.

**Passion-Driven** — We genuinely love building software and it shows in our attention to detail and commitment to projects.
